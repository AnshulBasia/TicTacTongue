# TicTacTongue
Contains Python code for implementing algorithms in TicTacTongue. 

TicTacTongue is a conceptual mini language that is used to assemble Earth's Mightiest Zeros - an unbeatable TicTacToe algorithm. (That's the mission)

This repo is mainly for members of the BVN CS Mailing List. It takes off where we left the first time, and introduces the concept of functions, or methods in a programming language. 

Visit the files in the following order:

* Functions.py
* ExtendedAPI.py
* Game.py

Your job is to complete Game.py
