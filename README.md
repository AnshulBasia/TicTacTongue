# TicTacTongue
Contains Python code for implementing algorithms in TicTacTongue. 

TicTacTongue is a conceptual mini language that is used to assemble Earth's Mightiest Zeros - an unbeatable TicTacToe algorithm. (That's the mission)

This repo is mainly for members of the BVN CS Mailing List, though any beginner in CS is welcome. It takes off where we left the first workshop, and introduces the concept of functions, or methods in a programming language. 

Contents have been subdivided into directories based on the topics covered. 

## Functions

This is the first topic covered after the workshop.

Visit the files in the following order:

* Functions.py
* Library.py
* ExtendedAPI.py
* Game.py

Your job is to go through the files and complete ExtendedAPI.py and Game.py. 

Update 14/8/15 - The "Defensive" strategy has been implemented. Check it out. A little cleaning up remains (adding docstrings, weeding out redundancies, etc).

## Dependencies

You need to have Python 2.7.x installed on your system.
